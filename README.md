# 👋 Hey there! I am Wout Deleu, and I'm a young Software Developer! Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🚀

🔍 I'm an 🧠 analytical thinker, 🧩 problem solver, a 🚀 tech enthusiast, and sport fanatic 🏸🏃‍♂️🏊‍♂️. If you've stumbled upon this corner of the internet, you'll get to know a bit about the things I'm passionate about and the projects I love to tinker with. Let's dive in!

📊 Analytical: I once made it to the finals of the Cybersecurity Challenge Belgium, which is like the World Cup for cybersecurity enthusiasts! It was a thrilling journey, testing my analytical and problem-solving skills. At university, I aced subjects that revolved around algorithms, and I genuinely enjoyed cracking complex problems. 🤓

📂 Structured: Order and structure are not just keywords in my code. Whether it's organizing my projects, planning my day, or keeping things neat and tidy, I strive for consistency and uniformity. This quality shines through in my code and my daily life. 🗂️

🦸‍♂️ Determined: Besides coding, I'm (almost) a Badminton Trainer B, and I've even run a half marathon (with an Iron Man on my bucket list)! I'm not one to give up easily. When I set my mind on something, I put in the effort to see it through. From building my own server to creating custom scripts and websites, I love sinking my teeth into personal projects. 💪

💻 Backend Lover, Full Stack Explorer: While I lean towards backend development, I also enjoy the thrill of full-stack development. My academic journey and experience during the AXXES Traineeship have provided me with a wealth of theoretical knowledge. Now, I'm on a quest to apply that knowledge to real-world challenges, and GitHub is where you'll find the evidence of my explorations. 🌐

🏋️ Off-screen Adventures: When I'm not typing away at my keyboard or solving complex puzzles, I'm engaging in a different kind of challenge. I'm a competitive badminton player, competing at the Flemish level, and a certified trainer for the West-Flemish Youth Selection. I also love to dabble in other sports like running, swimming, and calisthenics. Keeping an active and balanced lifestyle is important to me. 🏸
